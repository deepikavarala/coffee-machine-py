## Implementing a coffee machine using python


### Stage 3/6: Enough coffee for everyone

**Description**:

A real coffee machine doesn't have an infinite supply of water, milk, or coffee beans. And if you input a really big number, it's almost certain that a real coffee machine wouldn't have the supplies needed to make all that coffee for you.
In this stage, you need to improve the previous program. Now you will check amounts of water, milk, and coffee beans available in your coffee machine at the moment.

Like in the previous stage, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffee beans to make one cup of coffee.

### Stage 4/6: Action!

**Description**:

Let's simulate an actual coffee machine! What do we need for that? This coffee machine will have a limited supply of water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups. Also, it will calculate how much money it gets for selling coffee.

There are several options for the coffee machine we want you to implement: first, it should sell coffee. It can make different types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Of course, each variety requires a different amount of supplies, however, in any case, you will need only one disposable cup for a drink. Second, the coffee machine must get replenished by a special worker. Third, another special worker should be able to take out money from the coffee machine.

At the moment, the coffee machine has $550, 400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans, and 9 disposable cups.
